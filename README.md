# CyberPushkin

CyberPushkin is an application of neural net machine learning algorithm set to generate realistic short poems. 

## Getting started

### System requirements

NOTE: Our project team's set of available hardware was limited to 3 fairly average computers, so we cannot guarantee that this application will or will not run smoothly on your PC. Take this information with a grain of salt.

CPU: We recommend you use at least dual-core processor. Learning process will take up varying portion of system resources, if you have old hardware, consider closing all concurrent applications.
GPU: Enough GPU compute power to run web-sites. No screen resolution restrictions.
Memory: Your system should have at least 4 GB of memory to run this application smoothly.
Machine must be running Windows 7, 8 or 10 to run this application, and must follow minimum system requirements for Visual Studio 2017.

If you don't meet the requirements, you might be able to run it, it will just take more time to run.

### Prerequisites

## Acknowledgments

We were inspired to creating CyberPushkin thanks to automatization. If we could automatically update our project, build etc. why couldn't we do the same with poems?
Thanks to Roman Mazur for helping us broaden our view on software engineering and providing us helpful information on how to set up our project and integrate it with different services.
Thanks to our *alpha-testers*:
